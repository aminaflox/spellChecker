## A simple spell-checker application in Java
### Introduction
#### The application takes a list of words and uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm to check the spelling of the words in an input string. The Levenshtein distance algorithm is used to calculate the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one word into another.
#### By using the Levenshtein distance, the application can identify misspelled words in the input string and provide suggestions for possible correct spellings.
